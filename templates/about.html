<h1>About the game: Fox and Hounds</h1>
<p>
    Fox and Hounds is played on an 8Ã—8 chess/checkerboard and only the dark squares are used (in our case the grass aka
    green squares). The four hounds are initially placed on the dark squares at one edge of the board; the fox is placed
    on any dark square on the opposite edge. The objective of the fox is to cross from one side of the board to the
    other, arriving at any one of the hounds' original squares. The hounds' objective is to prevent the fox from doing
    so by trapping it.
</p>
<h3>Game Rules:</h3>
<p>
    The hounds can only move diagonally forward one square. The fox can move diagonally
    forward or backward one square. There is no jumping/eliminating/promoting of pieces in this game. The game starts
    with the fox moving first. The player controlling the hounds may move only one of them each turn.
    The fox is trapped when it can no longer move to a vacant square. It is possible for two hounds to trap the fox
    against an edge of the board (other than their original home-row) or even one corner where a single
    hound may do the trapping. Should a hound reach the fox's original home row it will be unable to move further.
